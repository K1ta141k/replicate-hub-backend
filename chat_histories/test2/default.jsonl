We then define two functions, `draw_rectangle` and `draw_triangle`, which use the Turtle module to draw a rectangle and a triangle, respectively.\n\nIn the `main` function, we set up a Turtle screen and a Turtle object. We then define a list of shapes to draw, and use the `random.choice` function to select one of the shapes at random. We then call the selected shape function, passing our Turtle object as an argument.\n\nFinally, we start the Turtle's main loop with `window.mainloop()`.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10T10:48:17.225509"}
